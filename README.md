VueDart lets you create Vue web apps using Dart.

## Website and documentation

## Status

What works:

- App and component definitions.
- Templates.
- Data.
- Properties.
- Computed data.
- Methods.
- Refs.
- Lifecycle callbacks.
- Mixins.
- vue-router.
- Scoped styles.

What doesn't work:

- Render functions (or at least, they don't work *well*).
- Some of the [instance properties](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Instance-Properties).
- Server-side rendering.
- Hardcoded support for the Vuex plugin.
- Generic plugin support (this is going to take a while though).

## Logo

Based on the [official Vue logo](https://github.com/vuejs/art). I basically just changed
the color.
