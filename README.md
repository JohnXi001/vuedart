# VueDart

![Logo](/logo/logo.png)

VueDart is a WIP project to let you create Vue web apps using Dart.

## Status

- Basic apps and component definitions work.
- A lot of stuff still doesn't!

## Logo

Based on the [official Vue logo](https://github.com/vuejs/art). I basically just changed
the color.
